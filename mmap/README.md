Marauder's Map
--------------
This project was to display a web page that is a google map, with a custom pin of the user's current location and additional pins marking the corresponding user's last logged location with windows displaying the username and the distance from the current user. The current user is hardcoded into the page. While displaying windows for every pin may be annoying to the user, it was done to be in keeping with the "real" Marauder's Map.

The data is gotten from a server created using Node.js in a following assignment hosted on Heroku, which uses a MongoDB database.

This webpage and server were used for another class member's security analysis. So that there were flaws to find, I did not make either portion very secure.

Goals for this assignment:
* become familiar with web APIs
* become familiar with AJAX requests
