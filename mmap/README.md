Marauder's Map
--------------
* To the best of my knowledge, all elements have been correctly implemented.
  * I interpreted the instructions to mean that there should be an info window over every pin upon creation, as the Harry Potter marauders map has
* I discussed methods of iterating over arrays with Tyler Lubeck.
* I discussed parsing the JSON and what to do with the parsed data with Kyle Slinger.
* I spent roughly 6 hours on this assignment
